In Sanskrit: Āryavajracchedikā-prajñāpāramitā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra
In Tibetan: The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra "The Perfection of Wisdom that Cuts Like a Diamond"
Homage to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.
Thus have I heard at one time:
The Blessed One was dwelling in Śrāvastī, in the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada's park, together with a great assembly of 1,250 monks and a great number of bodhisattva mahāsattvas.
Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, put on his outer robe, took his alms bowl, and went into the great city of Śrāvastī for alms.
After the Blessed One had gone for alms in the great city of Śrāvastī, partaken of the meal, and completed the act of eating,
He put away his alms bowl and outer robe, washed his feet, arranged his seat, sat down cross-legged, straightened his body, and placed his attention in front of himself.
Then many monks approached the Blessed One,
And having approached, prostrated with their heads at the Blessed One's feet, circumambulated him three times, and sat to one side.
At that time, the venerable Subhūti was also seated in that very assembly.
Then the venerable Subhūti rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, placed his palms together, and bowed toward the Blessed One.
He addressed the Blessed One thus:
"O Blessed One, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha has bestowed benefit upon the bodhisattva mahāsattvas with the highest benefit, and the Tathāgata has entrusted the bodhisattva mahāsattvas with the highest entrustment. O Blessed One, this is wondrous!
O Sugata, this is wondrous!
Blessed One, how should one who has correctly entered the bodhisattva vehicle abide?
How should one practice?
How should one control the mind?"
Thus he spoke, and
The Blessed One replied to the venerable Subhūti:
"Excellent, excellent, Subhūti!
Subhūti, it is just as you say.
The Tathāgata has indeed bestowed benefit upon the bodhisattva mahāsattvas with the highest benefit.
The Tathāgata has indeed entrusted the bodhisattva mahāsattvas with the highest entrustment.
Therefore, Subhūti, listen well and bear in mind,
I shall explain to you how one who has correctly entered the bodhisattva vehicle should abide, how one should practice, and how one should control the mind."
"Yes, Blessed One," replied the venerable Subhūti, and listened accordingly.
The Blessed One said this to him:
"Here, Subhūti, one who has correctly entered the bodhisattva vehicle should think thus: 'However many beings there are in the universe of beings, whether born from an egg, born from a womb, born from heat and moisture, or born miraculously; whether with form or without form; whether with perception, without perception, or with neither perception nor non-perception; whatever realm of beings is conceived, I shall lead them all to nirvana, into the realm of nirvana without remainder.'
